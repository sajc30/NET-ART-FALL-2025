                    <div class="curatorial-text">
                        <p>Welcome to the Old Internet explores the rise, disappearance, and rebirth of the Web 1.0 era — specifically the years 1994–2004, when millions of users built personal webpages on GeoCities. This early web was a place of raw creativity: flashing GIFs, starry backgrounds, handmade code, scrolling text, and visitor counters. It was an internet defined by personality, experimentation, and community — a time when users created the web themselves rather than scrolling through platform-controlled feeds.</p>
                        
                        <p>When GeoCities shut down in 2009, nearly an entire generation of internet culture was wiped out. But artists and archivists have worked to preserve what remains — and reinterpret the Web 1.0 aesthetic for today. This exhibition brings together three works that each approach GeoCities differently: as digital ruins, as collaged memories, and as living inspiration for a new generation of online creators.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Deleted City (2011) visualizes 650GB of archived GeoCities data as a navigable city, highlighting the platform's once-thriving digital neighborhoods. Cameron's World (2015) reconstructs GeoCities imagery and text into a sprawling nostalgic collage. Esoterical on NeoCities shows how users continue to revive and reinvent Web 1.0 aesthetics, blending retro design with modern surrealist "dreamcore" sensibilities.</p>
                        
                        <p>Together, these works show that the early web hasn't been lost — it has been remembered, remixed, and reborn. In returning to GeoCities, artists and users alike seek a more personal, experimental, and human kind of internet.</p>
