      [PLANET VEGETA — FINAL TRANSMISSION]<br>
      Subject: Infant Kakarot. Power Level: 2.<br>
      Mission: Earth. Status: Launched moments before planetary destruction.<br>

      <h2>What is a Saiyan?</h2>
      <p>
        The Saiyans were a warrior race: proud, fierce, and driven by an instinct to fight. 
        They lived for battle, growing stronger after every defeat. Their home, Planet Vegeta, 
        orbited a red sun and bred warriors who could shake mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        But their world was destroyed by the tyrant Frieza, who feared what they might become. 
        Only a handful survived. One of them was a baby named <strong>Kakarot</strong>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card scroll-reveal delay-2">
      <h2>The Power of Transformation</h2>
      <p>
        What makes Saiyans unique is their ability to <em>transform</em>. When pushed to their 
        absolute limits through rage, grief, or sheer will, their bodies unlock new forms. 
        Hair changes color, auras ignite, and power multiplies beyond measure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each transformation in this story represents a breakthrough. Not just in strength, 
        but in spirit. They're moments where Goku becomes something <em>more</em>, not for 
        glory, but for the people counting on him.
