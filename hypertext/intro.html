      <strong style="color: var(--db-orange);">Who is Goku?</strong><br>
      Born as Kakarot on the dying planet Vegeta, he was sent to Earth as an infant, destined to conquer. 
      But a bump on the head changed everything. Raised with love by his grandfather Gohan, 
      he became Son Goku: a pure-hearted warrior with an insatiable hunger for growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes Goku special isn't just his power. It's his endless drive to push beyond limits. 
      Every battle, every loss, every friend made along the way shapes him into something more.
    </p>
    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-style: italic;">
      This is the story of his transformations, each one a breakthrough born from struggle, 
      sacrifice, and the will to protect those he loves.
